# Dummy_Repo

I only wish to submit the "Software Engineering/Development/Testing Work Prompt" and not the "Artificial Intelligence Work Prompt." However, the website would not let me submit my application without attaching a valid Github URL for the AI Prompt. Therefore, I made this dummy repo for the AI prompt. <br>

Thank you.
